# pCreode_trend_fits
Expression trend fits along p-Creode trajectories

[`WT_trend_fits.ipynb`](WT_trend_fits.ipynb) and [`Atoh_trend_fits.ipynb`](Atoh_trend_fits.ipynb) contain gene expression trend plots and generalized additive model fits along **p-Creode** trajectories for cell types identified in normal and _Atoh1_-knockout mouse colonic epithelium, respectively.
